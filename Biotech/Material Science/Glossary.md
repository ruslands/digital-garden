# Atomic Number and Elements

The **atomic number** is the number of protons in an atom’s nucleus. It’s the defining characteristic of an element—what distinguishes hydrogen (1 proton) from oxygen (8 protons). Think of it as an atom’s unique ID on the periodic table.

## Key Facts About Atomic Number
- **Notation**: Written as a subscript before the element’s symbol (e.g., ₆C for carbon, with 6 protons).
- **Element Identity**: Determines the element because the number of protons dictates how many electrons a neutral atom has, shaping its chemical behavior.
  - Example: All atoms with 26 protons are iron (Fe), regardless of neutron count.
- **Periodic Table**: Increases by one from left to right, starting with hydrogen (1) and reaching oganesson (118), the heaviest known element to date.
- **Vs. Mass Number**: Unlike the **mass number** (protons + neutrons), which varies between isotopes, the atomic number is fixed for each element.

# Building Blocks of Atoms

Atoms, the foundation of all matter in the universe, are made of three fundamental particles: **electrons**, **protons**, and **neutrons**.

## Electron
- **Description**: A tiny, negatively charged particle orbiting the nucleus.
- **Mass**: Extremely light compared to protons and neutrons.
- **Role**: Crucial in electricity, chemical bonding, and atom interactions.

## Proton
- **Description**: A positively charged particle in the nucleus, the atom’s core.
- **Mass**: About 1,836 times heavier than an electron.
- **Role**: Defines the element (e.g., 1 proton = hydrogen, 6 protons = carbon).

## Neutron
- **Description**: A neutral (no charge) particle in the nucleus.
- **Mass**: Roughly equal to a proton.
- **Role**: Stabilizes the nucleus; varying numbers create isotopes of the same element.

### Structure
- Protons and neutrons form the nucleus, while electrons orbit around it.
- The balance of these particles determines an atom’s charge and stability.

# Can Atoms Lose Particles?

Yes, atoms can lose electrons, protons, or neutrons, but the processes and outcomes differ:

## Losing an Electron
- **Process**: Common in chemical reactions; energy (heat, light, collisions) can remove electrons.
- **Result**: The atom becomes a positively charged **ion** (specifically a **cation**), with more protons than electrons.
  - Example: Sodium (Na) loses an electron to become Na⁺ in table salt (NaCl).

## Losing a Proton
- **Process**: Rare; occurs in nuclear reactions like positron emission, where a proton transforms into a neutron.
- **Result**: Changes the element entirely (e.g., losing a proton shifts the atomic number down by 1).
- **Context**: Involves nuclear forces, not typical chemistry.

## Losing a Neutron
- **Process**: Happens in nuclear reactions like fission or neutron emission.
- **Result**: Creates a different **isotope** of the same element; the atomic number stays the same.
- **Context**: Seen in extreme conditions (e.g., nuclear reactors, stars).

### Summary
- **Electrons**: Easy to lose, drives chemistry.
- **Protons/Neutrons**: Requires nuclear physics, alters the atom fundamentally.

# Ions and Cations

## What is an Ion?
An **ion** is an atom or molecule with an electric charge due to gaining or losing electrons. Ions are categorized into two types:
- **Cations**: Positive charge (lost electrons).
- **Anions**: Negative charge (gained electrons).

## What is a Cation?
A **cation** is an ion that has lost one or more electrons, resulting in a positive charge (more protons than electrons).
- **Formation**: Occurs when metals lose electrons in chemical reactions (e.g., forming ionic compounds like NaCl).
- **Examples**:
  - Sodium (Na, 11 protons, 11 electrons) → Na⁺ (11 protons, 10 electrons).
  - Magnesium (Mg) → Mg²⁺ (loses 2 electrons).
- **Applications**: Found in batteries, electrolytes, and biological processes (e.g., nerve signaling).

## Cation vs. Ion
- **Ion**: General term for any charged particle (positive or negative).
- **Cation**: Specific type of ion with a positive charge.
  - Example: Ca²⁺ (calcium cation) vs. Cl⁻ (chloride anion).

# Synthesizing New Elements

The number of protons defines an element, so adding or removing protons creates new types of matter. This is achieved in nuclear physics.

## How It Works
- **Adding Protons**: Particles (e.g., neutrons or nuclei) are fired at an atom in a particle accelerator or reactor.
  - If protons are captured (or neutrons decay into protons), the atomic number increases, forming a new element.
  - Example: Carbon (6 protons) + particles → Nitrogen (7 protons).
- **Synthetic Elements**: Examples include:
  - **Technetium** (43 protons).
  - **Plutonium** (94 protons).
  - **Oganesson** (118 protons), made by smashing calcium-48 into californium-249.

## Challenges
- Requires immense energy to overcome nuclear repulsion.
- Heavier elements (beyond uranium, 92 protons) are unstable, decaying in milliseconds.

# Heaviest Known Element

The highest number of protons in any known matter is **118**, found in **oganesson**.
- **Discovery**: Synthesized in 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), Russia, by combining californium-249 (98 protons) and calcium-48 (20 protons).
- **Properties**:
  - Superheavy (beyond atomic number 104).
  - Unstable, with a half-life of less than a millisecond.
  - Unknown physical state (gas or solid?) due to limited atoms produced.
- **Future**: Scientists aim for elements like 120 or 126 protons, possibly reaching an “island of stability” where nuclei last longer.
