electrochemical method for oxygen measurements in biological fluids and made the discovery that if the Pt electrode used for detection could be separated from the biological medium by a gas permeable membrane, reliable measurements were possible. This approach was extended by immobilizing glucose oxidase on a membrane and measuring the reduction in oxygen levels as a result of the enzymatic reaction.5 A miniaturized form of this sensor was proposed and referred to as the enzyme electrode

Some sensors remained functional for up to a year based on a special nonlinear calibration algorithm. Beyond that, the longevity of the sensor was mainly compromised by a gradual loss of enzyme activity.

All the above systems employ glucose oxidase and some electrochemical method for assessing the rate of the enzyme-catalyzed oxidation of glucose. There are two fundamental disadvantages of this approach: the sensing element must be in direct contact with biological fluid and the process of measurement requires the con- sumption of glucose.

For these reasons, several alternative approaches have been developed they fall into two categories:

1. first, spectroscopic measurements (

2. optical rotation,
3. near-infrared,
4. Raman)

for which a specific molecular signature has been identified, and

1. second, measurements of glucose binding to specific agents where spectroscopic changes permit the binding process to be followed (

2. fluorescent or other optical changes associated with glucose binding to boronic acid derivatives or
3. binding to lectins such as concanavalin A)

The discussion of sensors, especially those used for continuous monitoring, will be based on biosensors using glucose oxidase with electrochemical detection. The sensors generally adhere to the following sequence of reactions of enzyme, E, and mediator, M:

Eox þ glucose ! Ered þ gluconic acid Ered þ O2 ! Eox þ H2O2

Ered þ Mox ! Eox þ Mred

ð1:1Þ ð1:2Þ ð1:20Þ

An exogenous mediator such as ferrocene or Os(III) may be employed to accept electrons from the reduced enzyme, but it must be realized that reaction (1.2) can still take place because oxygen will be present in any case. Oxygen can diffuse freely within the reaction layer but the mediator cannot because it will be anchored to prevent leaching out of the sensor. The enzymatic reaction obeys Michaelis– Menten kinetics according to what is called a ‘‘ping-pong’’ reaction, the sequence of reactions (1.1) and (1.2)/(1.20). The objective in sensor design is to make reaction (1.1) the rate-determining step, meaning that its rate is proportional to the concentration of glucose.

The wearable device may experience a strong electromagnetic field, a shower, moving from a warm to a cold environment, or impact on the monitoring unit or sensor that generates spurious signals.

Redox - reduction–oxidation or oxidation–reduction is a type of chemical reaction in which the oxidation states of a substratechange.

Oxidation is the loss of electrons or an increase in the oxidation state, while reduction is the gain of electrons or a decrease in the oxidation state.

A cofactor is a non-protein molecule that supports a biochemical reaction. Cofactors can take the form of metal ions, organic substances or other molecules with beneficial characteristics not typically present in amino acids.

Apoenzyme or apoprotein is an enzymatically inactive protein part of an enzyme, which requires a cofactor for its activity.

The two families of enzymes that are most widely used in the electrooxidation of glucose are glucose oxidases (GOx)23 and PQQ-glucose dehydrogenases (PQQ-GDH).

The two enzyme families differ in their redox potentials, the strengths of the bonds between their protein-devoid apoenzymes and their cofactors, their cosubstrates, their turnover rates, their Michaelis constants (Km), and their selectivity for glucose.

The FAD cofactor of GOx is strongly bound to apo-GOx and FADH2-GOx reacts with O2 to yield FAD-GOx and H2O2. The apparent formal redox potential of GOx at 25 °C at pH 5.3 is -0.063 ( 0.011 V versus SHE; at pH 9.3 it is -0.200 ( 0.010 V versus SHE.36 Nevertheless, according to a recent re-estimate the apparent formal redox potential of GOx at pH 7.2 is -0.048 V versus SHE.37 GOx is relatively specific for glucose. In the electrochemically relevant half-reaction in which glucose is oxidized by FAD- GOx, about 5 × 103 glucose molecules are oxidized per second.15

PQQ-GDH catalyzes not only the oxidation of glucose, but also of other sugars; the PQQ cofactor is moderately well bound to the apoenzyme in the presence of excess Ca2+, which also stabilizes the binding of the PQQ-cofactor by the apoenzyme.38 Its redox potential at pH 7.0, in the presence of excess Ca2+, is 10.5 ( 4 mV versus SHE.38 Unlike the FADH2 of GOx, the PQQH2 of GDH is not oxidized by O2.39 In the half-reaction of PQQ-GDH, in which glucose is oxidized, 11,800 glucose molecules are oxidized per second.

In addition to PQQ-GDH, two other members of the dehydrogenase family have begun to see application in electrochemical glucose detection. These are NAD-dependent GDH40 and FAD-dependent GDH.41 These enzymes com- bine the oxygen independence of PQQ-GDH with the specificity (toward nonglucose sugars) of GOx, and it is likely that they will be more widely used in the future.

The new ISO 15197:2013 standard (applicable from May 2016) states that the accuracy of the test strips should be within ±20% of laboratory results for concentrations above 5.6 mmol/L and within ±0.83 mmol/L for lower concentrations.

Glucose oxidase (GOx), the most popular enzyme used for glucose detection, is able to reduce oxygen to hydrogen peroxide while at the same time transforming glucose to D-glucono-1,5-lactone. Quantification of glucose can be achieved based on either the detection of the hydrogen peroxide produced or the oxygen consumed.

Three generations of glucose oxidase biosensors were proposed until now. The first generation is based on measuring peroxide formation and necessitates oxygen, the second uses an additional mediator which transports electrons from the enzyme active site to the electrode, and the third is based on direct electron transfer between GOx and the electrode.2

Regarding the construction of commercial electrodes, products manufactured by Abbot use FAD-GDH and NAD- GDH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), Bayer uses FAD- GDH, Johnson & Johnson uses both FAD-GDH and GOx and Roche Diagnostics mainly PQQ-GDH (pyrroloquinoline quinone).3 The chosen mediator should reoxidize at relatively low potentials (<0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl) to minimize the influence of exo- (e.g., ibuprofen, salicylic acid, paracetamol) and endogenous (e.g., hemoglobin, bilirubin, uric acid) interfer- ences and should rapidly dissolve in the sample as the fastest assays are now completed in around 4 s.19 Most of the meters rely on a ferricyanide mediator,2,20,21 except for the Abbot devices that use phenanthroline quinone,20 a ferrocene derivative, or an osmium complex.21

 The SDS's recognition site was left on the surface of the PGA film after extraction using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique, facilitating the specific detection of SDS. Moreover, the ZnONPs ($71 nm, polydispersity index of 0.138) were synthesized and effectively combined with the MIP by a drop-casting method, enhancing the current response. The surface of the prepared SPCE–ZnONPs/MIP was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray.

2.3 Screen-printed carbon electrode fabrication

The schematic diagram for the fabrication of screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE) is illustrated in Fig. 1. As shown, the electrodes were deposited onto an alumina substrate surface (10 mm  25 mm). The reference electrode was printed using silver paste (Fig. 2a) and dried in the oven. The substrate was then calcinated at 750 C using a furnace. The working and counter electrodes were printed using carbon paste onto the substrate and dried in an oven at 110 C (Fig. 2b).

Further, an insulator paste was printed for the encapsulation layer (Fig. 2c). The silver electrode was modied using the electroplating technique in KCl 0.1 M with Pt wire to form a silver/silver chloride electrode. Finally, the surface of SPCE was activated using 50 mL of 0.1 M NaOH to remove the impu- rities during the fabrication process.

According to the data from World Health Organization (WHO), the number of adults living with diabetes has quadrupled from 1980 to nowadays, reaching 422 million

Currently, enzymatic based test strips, including glucose oxidase and glucose dehydrogenasee, have occupied almost 85% of the glucose biosensor market by inter- mittently checking of blood plasma through finger pricks.

Since the first commercialized glucose biosensor was released by Yellow Spring Instrument Inc. (YSI Inc.), enzymatic glucose biosensor has gone through three generations and its performance has been significantly improved with the use of mediators for elec- tron transfer or the use of nanomaterials for direct electron trans- fer, which has been summarized in a recent review

Glucose was directly electrooxidized to gluconic acid in a sulfuric acid solution at a lead anode in 1909 by Walther Loeb.17 In 1937, the Atlas Powder Company manufactured sorbitol commercially by electroreducing glucose in a NaOH- Na2SO4 solution at an amalgamated lead electrode in a diaphragm cell.18 Studies of direct electrooxidation19 and electroreduction20 of glucose in basic (pH > 11) and acidic (pH < 1) solutions continue to date. At pH 7.4 glucose has been directly electrooxidized, at a current density of 1 mA cm-2, on an electrode coated with a 4,4′,4′′,4′′′-tetrasulfo- phthalocyanine complex of molybdenum oxide.

21 Nevertheless, partial oxidation products of glucose irreversibly adsorb on and poison most electrocatalysts.22 Hence, electrochemical assays of biological glucose solutions utilize glucose oxidation catalyzing enzymes.

Ключом ко всему является датчик. Его химия проста: сверхчистый золотой провод покрывается [глюкозооксидазой](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%93%D0%BB%D1%8E%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B0), ферментом, получаемым из бактерии Penicillium notatum. Этот фермент окисляет β-D-глюкозу до глюконо-1,5-лактона, который спонтанно гидролизуется до глюконовой кислоты. При этом образуется пероксид водорода. Пероксид окисляется на золотом проводе, и возникающий ток пропорционален концентрации глюкозы во внутритканевой жидкости. Ток считывается системой и используется для подсчёта оценки концентрации глюкозы в крови на основе калибровочной кривой.

Но, хотя химия проста, трудности человеческой биологии и производства усложняют задачу практического использования датчика НМГ. Во-первых, датчики нужно вставлять во внутритканевую жидкость, и оставлять там на несколько дней (хотя многие растягивают этот срок, чтобы экономить на датчиках). Посторонний объект в теле, провод, покрытый белками, полученными от бактерии, провоцирует иммунную систему, которая заточена на борьбу с подобными вторжениями. Без защиты глюкозооксидаза, благодаря которой работает датчик, будет уничтожена иммунной системой за несколько часов. Поэтому датчику требуются особые проприетарные покрытия, пропускающие глюкозу, но некоторое время не дающие иммунной системе атаковать фермент.

The basic technology is considered to be the electrochemical method for measuring metabolites in the interstitial fluid, synthesis of enzymes, and the method of enzyme immobilization on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode.

The technology addresses the task of simultaneous measurement of the concentration levels of several metabolites - glucose, ketone bodies, lactic and uric acids, and other metabolites.

Electrochemical method for measuring metabolites

For glucose measurement utilizes the enzyme glucose oxidase, which catalyzes the transfer of two hydrogen atoms from the first carbon atom of glucose to oxygen dissolved in the liquid reagent. As a result of this reaction, hydrogen peroxide is formed in equimolar amounts. Thus, the concentration of the generated hydrogen peroxide precisely equals the concentration of glucose being determined.

For ketone bodies, an enzyme specific to their oxidation is employed, catalyzing the transfer of electrons from ketone bodies to the electrode surface. This electron transfer generates a measurable current directly proportional to the concentration of ketone bodies present.

For lactic acid quantification involves the use of lactate oxidase enzyme, As a result of this reaction, hydrogen peroxide is formed in equimolar amounts. Thus, the concentration of the generated hydrogen peroxide precisely equals the concentration of glucose being determined.

For uric acid detection utilizes the enzyme uricase, which catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid to allantoin. This enzymatic process results in the generation of electrons, leading to a measurable current proportional to the concentration of uric acid in the sample.
