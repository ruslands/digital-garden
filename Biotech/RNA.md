========3'UTR& miRNA=========

3′-UTR может принимать участие в регуляции эффективности трансляции, стабильности мРНК, содержать сигналы полиаденилирования и сайты связывания микроРНК, а также выполнять ряд других регуляторных функций.

Длина 3′-UTR может составлять от 60 до 4000 нуклеотидов. Средняя длина 3′-UTR у человека составляет около 800 нуклеотидов.

Примечательно, что общая длина 3′-UTR у человека более чем в два раза превосходит таковую у остальных млекопитающих, что свидетельствует о большем, чем у других млекопитающих, числе регуляторных элементов у людей.

увеличение 3′-UTR мРНК с 19 до 156 нуклеотидов уменьшало экспрессию в 45 раз.

длина 3′-UTR имеет важное значение в экспрессии мРНК

Другим фактором, определяющим важность длины 3′-UTR, кроме взаимодействия 3′- и 5′-UTR, является способность 3’-UTR к взаимодействию с микроРНК — особыми регуляторными молекулами РНК, подавляющими трансляцию

Вторичная структура(конфирмация) 3’-UTR имеет гораздо большее значение, чем считалось ранее. Важна не только длина 3’-UTR, но и её вторичная структура, и мутации, изменяющие её, могут нарушить экспрессию гена.

Наиболее распространённым примером элементов вторичной структуры, способных влиять на экспрессию, является шпилька.

3’-UTR именно со шпильками связываются РНК-связывающие белки. ,то есть белок связывается со шпилькой только потом связывается с миРНК.

AREs(AU-rich elements, AREs), связываются с белками (англ. ARE-binding proteins, ARE-BPs), которые, как правило, способствуют разрушению мРНК в ответ на различные внутри- и внеклеточные сигналы, хотя некоторые из них регулируют трансляцию.

МикроРНК — короткие одноцепочечные некодирующие молекулы РНК эндогенного происхождения длиной около 20 нуклеотидов. Они взаимодействуют с мРНК-мишенями по принципу комплементарности и обычно блокируют трансляцию мишени или вызывают её разрушение.

С помощью методов биоинформатики на основании анализа первичной структуры (то есть последовательности нуклеотидов) можно искать элементы ARE и сайты связывания с микроРНК в данной 3′-UTR

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of naturally occurring, small non-coding RNA molecules of about 22 nucleotides in length. They regulate gene expression, mainly through mRNA degradation or translational repression, by binding to partially complementary regions within their target mRNAs. This targeting process is highly flexible in the sense that a miRNA can regulate many mRNAs, and conversely, a single mRNA can be regulated by several miRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are in the range of 20-24 nucleotides in length and play important roles in the regulation of gene expression. In plants, this is typically performed through post-transcriptional cleavage and subsequent degradation of their target genes

The mammalian genome contains thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which have been proposed to be fundamental in the regulation of many biological processes.

Despite an exponential increase in the number of lncRNA associated with cancer progression, most oncogenic lncRNA remain functionally uncharacterised.

Long non-coding RNAs are recognized as a new class of regulatory molecules despite very little is known about their functions in the cellular processes.

Due to their overall low expression level and tissue-specificity, the identification and annotation of lncRNA genes still remains challenging.

However, technical limitations mean that most experimental studies are still limited to seeking major regulatory events where one miRNA leads to significant down-regulation of the target and the remaining lower-level regulatory events cannot be reliably measured. Here, we present an integrated computational and experimental platform that allows a direct and high throughput mapping of miRNA:target-RNA interactions, where we identify and validate miRNA-mRNA interactions to a much higher resolution. Our prediction tool miRAW, based on deep learning, uses the entire miRNA and 3’UTR mRNA target nucleotides as inputs, and automatically learns a set of feature descriptors uninhibited by limits in current knowledge regarding the targeting process. This not only allows us to assess the impact of mutations in the target site region, but also to predict how miRNA isoform variations can affect the functionality of a target. Our experimental platform is also flexible in such a way that it can be used to validate data coming from the prediction as well as to generate unbiased and balanced experimental datasets that improve the performance of miRAW, which in turn feeds back to our experimental pipeline.

Some of our highly-expressed diseases-associated lncRNAs, such as MIR22HG and DANCR, have been implicated in various cancers, including HGSOC. Given their high gene expression and strong association with HGSOC disease and various cancers, these 24 highly-expressed diseases-associated lncRNAs could form the basis of our potential future validation targets, albeit requiring further analysis.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6)-type cytokines share the common receptor glycoprotein 130 (gp130), which activates a signaling cascade involving Janus kinases (JAKs) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) transcription factors. IL-6 and/or its signaling pathway is often deregulated in diseases, such as chronic liver diseases and cancer.

MicroRNAs constitute a large family of ~21-nt-long RNAs that are loaded by Argonaute proteins to form the RISC complex which can silence specific target mRNAs. In metazoans, the RISC complex binds to perfectly or imperfectly complementary sequences, present most commonly in the 3 ́ UTRs of target mRNAs, causing mRNA translational repression or deadenylation. The spatial and temporal distribution of microRNAs in organisms is tightly regulated and aberrant microRNA expression leads to disease. Up to now, the regulation of microRNA levels has been mainly explained by the regulation of microRNA biogenesis alone, neglecting microRNA turnover pathways. However, recent studies have described an endogenous mechanism of microRNA degradation based on the binding of specific target RNAs to microRNAs with extensive complementarity. This emerging pathway, named TDMD for Target-Directed MicroRNA Degradation, directs highly specific microRNA decay throught microRNA 3 ́end tailing and 3 ́-to-5 ́ trimming, and in this way, provides a new layer of microRNA regulation. To date, in vivo examples have been observed mainly in some viruses and only three TDMD events have been characterized in metazoans. Based on published data about target RNA patterns leading to TDMD and phylogenetic conservation, we developed a computational tool for the in silico identification of RNA sites that induce microRNA degradation through TDMD. Supplemented with published RNA-seq and small-RNA-seq data, our software allows to focus on cell-specific TDMD inducer candidates. Our search uncovered several convincing candidates in mouse neurons and their molecular characterization is underway

miRNAs are key regulators of gene expression in animals and plants. They play an important role as modulators of many major cellular functions such as development, differentiation, growth, and metabolism. miRNAs also participate in intercellular communication. They are released from most cells, often within extracellular vesicles, and disseminate through the extracellular fluid to reach remote target cells, where they can play their role of regulators. This mechanism has promoted the hypothesis that miRNAs could be used also as bioactives.

miRNAs have emerged in recent years as interesting tools and targets for novel therapeutic approaches, including treatments of cancers and infections.
