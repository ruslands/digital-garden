estimated that over half of mammalian protein coding-genes are regulated by miRNAs and most human mRNAs have binding sites for miRNAs

200.000 миРнк приходят 20.000 молекул аргонафтов

5-10 мирнк составляют 90% всех мирнк

Each cell contains 46 chromosomes and 20.500 genes

Predicted 20k of genes, discovered few thousand.

Pharma R&D needs improvement:

1% chance to find a new drug        

10-15 years to get it on the market 

$2,000,000,000: the cost of a new drug

Drug design: long, risky and expensive

3 to 5 years from hit to candidate

10% success rate

$100M for a new drug candidate
