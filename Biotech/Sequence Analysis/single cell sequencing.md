Pluripotent stem cells 

Embryonic stem cells 

Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are precursors of mature germ cells—the oocyte and sperm. 

Tissue-specific stem cells reside in developing or differ- entiated tissues.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) generate all blood lineages. 

In situ is a Latin phrase that translates literally to "on site" or "in position." It can mean "locally", "on site", "on the premises"

By definition, a stem cell is characterized as both being capable of unlimited self- renewal and having the potential to differentiate into specialized types of cells. 

Stem cells are generally classi- fied into pluripotent stem cells, which can give rise to cells of all three germ layers (the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm), and tissue-specific stem cells, which play essential roles in the development of embryonic tis- sues and the homeostasis of adult tissues. 

Pluripotent stem cells in a mammalian early embryo are few in num- ber; tissue-specific stem cells always form a minor pro- portion of the cell population of a particular tissue or organ.

===tools single-cell SEQ===

biclustering-based algorithm called BackSPIN that increases the accuracy of identifying cell types from single-cell RNA-seq data. Grun et al. [37] de- veloped another algorithm called RaceID, which is based on a feature of the single-cell RNA-seq technique that creates extremely low false-positive errors if cross contamination is carefully controlled, especially when unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) are applied. 

bioinformatic analysis algorithms such as Monocle and Waterfall have been developed to provide a time-serial reconstruction of a developmental or differentiation process, 

DNA methylation is the major DNA modification in the mammalian genome and plays important roles in many developmental processes. Recently, single-cell DNA methylome sequencing methods have been re- ported by our group and others [74–76]. Our method (scRRBS) is based on the reduced representation bi- sulfite sequencing (RRBS) strategy [77], whereas the methods of Smallwood et al. (scBS-seq) [75] and Far- lik et al. (scWGBS) [76] are based on a post-bisulfite adaptor tagging (PBAT) approach

Cancer tissue usually contains sub-populations of cells that have strong phenotypic and functional heterogen- eity. The cancer stem cell (CSCs) concept holds that there is a sub-population of highly malignant stem cells at the top of the tumor cell hierarchy. The exist- ence of these CSCs, however, is still controversial in many cancer types. Single-cell RNA-seq has the potential to help identify these cells and, more generally, to provide new insight into complex intratumoral heterogeneity. 

Many bioinformatics tools that were designed for bulk RNA-seq analyses are also applicable to single-cell RNA- seq data; further tools have been designed specifically for analyses of single-cell RNA-seq data 

Methods allowing in situ single-cell RNA sequencing or highly multiplexed profiling 

methods for three-dimensional reconstructed RNA-seq at single-cell reso- lution have also been developed
