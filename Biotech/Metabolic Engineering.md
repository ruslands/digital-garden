Metabolic engineering - improvement of cellular activities by manipulation of enzymatic, transport, and regulatory functions of the cell with the use of recombinant DNA technology.

Metabolism - The set of life-sustaining chemical reactions within the cells of organisms

Metabolic pathway - In a cell, a chemical is converted into another chemical by a plurality of reactions under the catalysis of a series of enzymes. This series of (biochemical) reaction is called a metabolic pathway. The node of the metabolic pathway is called intermediate metabolite

Metabolic Network - Different metabolic pathways are linked together by associated nodes, forming a metabolic network within the cell.

Research strategies: Increase metabolic flux, Extend metabolic pathway, Construct new metabolic pathways.

Strategy I Increase metabolic flux to metabolites:

Enhance the expression level or activity of enzymes that catalyze reactions;

Blocking competitive metabolic pathways such as branch metabolic pathways;

Strategy II Extend metabolic pathway:

Introduction of foreign genes (clusters) by genetic engineering makes that the original metabolic pathways are further extended forward or backward, so that new raw materials can be utilized for synthesizing target products or generating new terminal metabolites.

Strategy III Build new metabolic pathways:

Introducing foreign genes (clusters) to engineer and modify metabolic networks, transforming cells from the inability to synthesize certain metabolites to synthesize this metabolite

Basic procedure:

-Identification of engineering target

• The determination of engineering targets is usually based on quantitative and control analysis of metabolic fluxes in metabolic networks.

• The selected targets usually include the gene to be modified, the metabolic pathway to be introduced, and the target to block the metabolic pathway.

-Gene manipulation

• Once the target is determined, consider using appropriate methods to genetically manipulate the target gene.

• General methods: Gene cloning, expression, modification, knockout, integration, etc.

• Attention should be paid to the strength of the gene modification. Only moderate modification can achieve the purpose of not destroying the fine equilibrium state within the cell, but also achieving high yield or synthesizing new target metabolites.

-Performance analysis

• It is necessary to conduct a comprehensive performance analysis on the constructed engineering strain.

• The problems displayed by the performance analysis often become the engineering targets of the new round of experiments.

• After multiple rounds of genetic manipulation, excellent engineering strains for production can often be obtained.

Synthetic biology is the design and construction of biological devices and systems for useful purposes.

The citrate cycle is considered the "hub" of cellular metabolism

Mechanisms of Gene Regulation - lac operon, ara operon, trp operon.

Thermodynamics is concerned with how much of a substance S can be converted into a product P at equilibrium,

whereas kinetics is concerned with how fast and by what pathway the conversion takes place.

FLUX - Rate of turnover of molecules through a reaction pathway.

Metabolic Flux Analysis (MFA) is an experimental technique used to determine fluxes in a metabolic network.

Two modeling approaches: Mechanistic (kinetic), Constraint-based (stoichiometric)

Genetic tools - Gene overexpression, Gene knockout, Evolutionary engineering, Global perturbation

Gene overexpression - Plasmid vectors, promoters, Tuning overexpression of multiple genes, Synthetic protein scaffolds

Plasmid vector Plasmid copy number affects the levels of gene expression
