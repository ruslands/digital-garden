### **C-Peptide**
- **What it is**: C-peptide (connecting peptide) is a small protein fragment produced when the pancreas makes insulin. Insulin starts as a larger molecule called proinsulin, which splits into insulin and C-peptide. 
- **Why it matters**: Measuring C-peptide levels in the blood can show how much insulin your pancreas is naturally producing. It’s often tested in diabetes to distinguish between type 1 (low/no insulin production) and type 2 (insulin resistance or variable production).
- **Normal range**: Typically 0.5–2.0 ng/mL (fasting), but this can vary by lab and context.
- **Fact**: Unlike insulin, C-peptide isn’t affected by injected insulin, so it’s a better marker for your body’s own insulin output.

### **Triglycerides**
- **What it is**: Triglycerides are a type of fat (lipid) found in your blood. They’re made from excess calories you eat, stored in fat cells, and used for energy between meals.
- **Why it matters**: High levels can increase the risk of heart disease, especially if paired with low HDL ("good" cholesterol) or high LDL ("bad" cholesterol). They’re often checked as part of a lipid panel.
- **Normal range**: Less than 150 mg/dL (fasting) is considered normal, but this depends on the lab and your health status.
- **Fact**: Levels can spike after a fatty meal or alcohol, so fasting tests are more reliable.
