## Macro and Micro Metrics

### The Importance of Both

**Key Insight:** If you validate all experiments by macro metrics (conversions, average check, signups, searches, etc.), then you can miss valuable insights. Not every change in your product can be described by a "big" metric that shows the success of your business.

**Macro Metrics:**
- High-level business indicators
- Overall product success
- Examples: Revenue, MAU, Conversion Rate

**Micro Metrics:**
- Detailed user behavior indicators
- Feature-level performance
- Examples: Time to complete task, Error rate, Feature usage

**Best Practice:** Use both macro and micro metrics to get a complete picture of product performance.

## Experiment-Driven Culture

### Understanding Competitive Analysis

**Key Insight:** If you work in a product design or UX field, you are probably familiar with competitive analysis. Often while creating a product we look at the most successful products in a niche as references.

**Important Warning:** The thing is, while we are exploring other products and their features, these companies are most likely running experiments. There is a big chance that we explore experimental features, and blindly implementing something similar to our product is a huge risk.

**Best Practice:** 
- Don't blindly copy features from competitors
- Understand that successful products run 500+ experiments a year
- Test your own hypotheses rather than copying

**Scale:** 500+ experiments a year (for mature product companies)
