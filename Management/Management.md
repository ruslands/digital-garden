## Project Management Methodologies

### Agile vs Scrum

**Key Distinction:**
> Agile is a philosophy, whereas Scrum is a type of Agile methodology

---

### Agile Project Management

**Definition:** A project philosophy or framework that takes an iterative approach towards the completion of a project.

**Four Key Values:**
1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

---

### Waterfall Project Management

**Definition:** Another popular strategy that takes a different approach to project management than Agile.

**Characteristics:**
- Linear in nature
- Doesn't allow for revisiting previous steps and phases
- Sequential progression through phases

**Comparison with Agile:**
- While Agile is iterative and adaptive, Waterfall is linear and sequential

---

### Kanban Project Management

**Definition:** A type of Agile methodology that seeks to improve the project management process through workflow visualization using a tool called a Kanban board.

**How it works:**
- **Kanban board** is composed of columns that depict a specific stage in the project management process
- **Cards or sticky notes** represent tasks placed in the appropriate stage
- As the project progresses, cards move from column to column until completed

---

### Scrum

**Definition:** An agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products, with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields such as personal task management.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Designed for teams of **ten or fewer members**
- Work is broken into goals that can be completed within **time-boxed iterations**, called **sprints**
- Sprints are **no longer than one month** and most commonly **two weeks**

**Scrum Meetings:**
- **Daily Scrum** - 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings to track progress
- **Sprint Review** - Demonstrate the work done
- **Sprint Retrospective** - Improve continuously
- **Sprint Planning** - Prepare next sprint's tasks
- **Backlog Refinement** - Refine and prepare backlog items

**Scrum Framework Meetings:**
1. Sprint Planning
2. Daily Scrum
3. Sprint Retrospective
4. Sprint Review
5. Backlog Refinement

---

### ScrumBan

**Definition:** A hybrid version of Scrum and Kanban.

**Benefits:**
- Combines the visualization of Kanban
- Uses the systematization of Scrum
- Doesn't introduce extra complexity
- Easy to adopt

**Reference:** [Avito Blog Article](https://habr.com/ru/company/avito/blog/589169/)

---

### Dual-Track Development

**Concept:** The entire product development process from idea to production deployment flows through two parallel streams: **Discovery** and **Delivery**.

#### Discovery Track

**Purpose:** Initiative development, qualitative and quantitative research, validation of problems and solutions.

**Discovery Team Composition:**
- Product Manager
- Development Team Lead
- Analyst
- BizDev Project Manager
- Designer
- UX Researcher

#### Delivery Track

**Purpose:** After the idea is developed, all necessary research is conducted, a focus problem is selected, and an optimal solution is chosen, the task moves to the development team.

**Delivery Team Composition:**
- Backend Engineers
- Frontend Engineers
- QA Engineers
- Mobile Engineers
- Product Manager (same person from Discovery)
- Development Team Lead (same person from Discovery)

**Note:** The Product Manager and Team Lead are the same people in both tracks, not separate individuals.

## Five Dysfunctions of a Team

### 1. Absence of Trust

**Problem:** Team members are unwilling to be vulnerable within the group.

**Impact:** Team members who are not genuinely open with one another about their mistakes and weaknesses make it impossible to build a foundation for trust.

---

### 2. Fear of Conflict

**Problem:** Teams that lack trust are incapable of engaging in unfiltered and passionate debate of ideas.

**Impact:** Instead of healthy conflict, they resort to veiled discussions and guarded comments.

**Root Cause:** This failure to build trust sets the tone for fear of conflict.

---

### 3. Lack of Commitment

**Problem:** Without having aired their opinions in the course of passionate and open debate, team members rarely buy in and commit to decisions.

**Impact:** They may feign agreement during meetings, but don't truly commit.

**Root Cause:** A lack of healthy conflict ensures lack of commitment.

---

### 4. Avoidance of Accountability

**Problem:** Without committing to a clear plan of action, even the most focused and driven people often hesitate to call their peers on actions and behaviors that seem counterproductive to the good of the team.

**Impact:** Team members don't hold each other accountable.

**Root Cause:** Lack of real commitment and buy-in leads to avoidance of accountability.

---

### 5. Inattention to Results

**Problem:** Team members put their individual needs (such as ego, career development, or recognition) or even the needs of their divisions above the collective goals of the team.

**Impact:** Team doesn't focus on achieving collective results.

**Root Cause:** Failure to hold one another accountable creates an environment where inattention to results can thrive.

---

## Product Prioritization

### RICE Score

**Definition:** A prioritization framework designed to help product managers determine which products, features, and other initiatives to put on their roadmaps by scoring these items according to four factors.

**Components:**
- **R** - Reach
- **I** - Impact
- **C** - Confidence
- **E** - Effort

---

### MoSCoW Method

**Definition:** A prioritization technique for managing requirements.

**Categories:**
- **M** - Must have
- **S** - Should have
- **C** - Could have
- **W** - Won't have (this time)

**Reference:** [Wikipedia - MoSCoW Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method)

---

### Cost of Delay

**Definition:** A prioritization method that considers the economic impact of delaying work.

**Purpose:** Helps prioritize work based on the cost of not doing it now.

---

### PriX Method

**Definition:** A prioritization framework (details to be expanded).

---

### Story Mapping

**Definition:** A visual technique for organizing user stories and understanding the user journey.

**Purpose:** Helps prioritize features based on user value and journey.

---

### PRINCE2

**Definition:** Projects In Controlled Environments - a project management method.

**Characteristics:**
- Structured project management methodology
- Process-based approach
- Widely used in various industries

---

### MECE

**Definition:** Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive.

**Purpose:** A principle for organizing information and breaking down problems.

**Characteristics:**
- **Mutually Exclusive** - Categories don't overlap
- **Collectively Exhaustive** - All possibilities are covered

---

### SMART Goals

**Definition:** A framework for setting effective goals.

**Components:**
- **S** - Specific
- **M** - Measurable
- **A** - Attainable
- **R** - Relevant
- **T** - Time-bound

---

### MBO (Management by Objectives)

**Definition:** A management approach where managers and employees work together to set, monitor, and achieve specific objectives.

---

### OKR (Objectives and Key Results)

**Definition:** A goal-setting framework used by organizations to define and track objectives and their outcomes.

**Structure:**
- **Objectives** - What you want to achieve
- **Key Results** - How you'll measure success

---

### INVEST Criteria

**Definition:** An acronym that combines six characteristics that a Product Backlog Item should possess to meet the Definition of Ready for Development.

**Components:**
- **I** – **Independent** (независимый от других) - Can be developed independently
- **N** – **Negotiable** (пригодный к обсуждению) - Can be discussed and refined
- **V** – **Valuable** (имеющий ценность для клиента) - Provides value to the customer
- **E** – **Estimable** (пригодный к оценке трудоемкости) - Can be estimated
- **S** – **Small** (пригодный к выполнению за один спринт) - Can be completed in one sprint
- **T** – **Testable** (пригодный к тестированию) - Can be tested
