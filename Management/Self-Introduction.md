## Sample Introduction (Polished Version)

> "Hey there, I'm Ruslan and I'm a 32-year-old software engineer. I've been working as a software engineer since I graduated in 2014. I started as a frontend developer for a bit, then switched over to being a data scientist where I trained machine learning algorithms and neural networks. After that, I got a really cool job as a bioinformatician in China. It was an exciting gig where we were doing gene editing and I was in charge of handling all the data. When COVID hit, I moved back to Belarus and tried to start my own startup, which unfortunately didn't work out. But, it was a great learning experience and helped me understand how businesses work. Now, I'm working on a project for a corporation."
