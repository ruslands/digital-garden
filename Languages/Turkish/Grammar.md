• Adjectives - прилагательные: these are words used to describe or modify nouns, indicating their attributes or qualities, such as color, size, shape, or emotion. In Russian, adjectives have gender, number, and case agreement with the nouns they modify.

• Adverbs - наречия: these are words used to modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, indicating the manner, time, place, degree, or frequency of the action or state described. In Russian, adverbs usually end in -о or -и and don't have gender, number, or case agreement.

• Conjunctions - союзы: these are words used to connect words, phrases, or clauses in a sentence, indicating the relationship between them, such as addition, contrast, comparison, or consequence. In Russian, conjunctions can be coordinating (like и "and", или "or") or subordinating (like когда "when", потому что "because").

• Determiners - определители: these are words used to specify or limit the meaning of a noun, indicating its definiteness, quantity, or possession, such as articles, demonstratives, or possessives. In Russian, determiners also have gender, number, and case agreement with the nouns they modify.

• Nouns - существительные: these are words used to name people, animals, things, or concepts, serving as the subject or object of a sentence. In Russian, nouns have gender, number, and case inflections that depend on their role in the sentence and their endings.

• Prepositions - предлоги: these are words used to indicate the relationship between a noun or pronoun and other words in a sentence, such as location, time, direction, or manner. In Russian, prepositions are followed by a noun or pronoun in a specific case, and their meanings can change depending on the case.

• Pronouns - местоимения: these are words used to replace nouns or noun phrases, indicating the person, thing, or concept referred to, such as personal, possessive, reflexive, or demonstrative pronouns. In Russian, pronouns also have gender, number, and case inflections, and their forms depend on their function in the sentence.

• Verbs - глаголы: these are words used to express an action, state, or occurrence in a sentence, indicating the tense, aspect, mood, or voice of the action, as well as the subject and the object involved. In Russian, verbs also have inflections for tense, aspect, mood, and agreement with the subject and the object in person and number.
